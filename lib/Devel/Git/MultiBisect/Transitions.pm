=head1 NAME

Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Transitions - Gather test output where it changes over a range of F<git> commits

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Transitions;

    $self = Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Transitions->new(\%parameters);

    $commit_range = $self->get_commits_range();

    $full_targets = $self->set_targets(\@target_args);

    $self->multisect_all_targets();

    $multisected_outputs = $self->get_multisected_outputs();

    $transitions = $self->inspect_transitions();
}

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Given a Perl library or application kept in F<git> for version control, it is
often useful to be able to compare the output collected from running one or
several test files over a range of F<git> commits.  If that range is sufficiently
large, a test may fail in B<more than one way> over that range.

If that is the case, then simply asking, I<"When did this file start to
fail?"> is insufficient.  We may want to capture the test output for each
commit, or, more usefully, may want to capture the test output only at those
commits where the output changed.

F<Devel::Git::MultiBisect> provides methods to achieve that objective.  More specifically:

=over 4

=item *

When the number of commits in the specified range is large and you only need
the test output at those commits where the output materially changed, you can
use this package, F<Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Transitions>.

=item *

When you want to capture the test output for each commit in a specified range,
you can use another package in this library, F<Devel::Git::MultiBisect::AllCommits>.

=back

=head1 METHODS

This package inherits methods from F<Devel::Git::MultiBisect>.  Only methods unique to
F<Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Transitions> are documented here.  See the documentation for
F<Devel::Git::MultiBisect> for all other methods, including:

    new()
    get_commits_range()
    set_targets()

=head2 C<multisect_all_targets()>

=over 4

=item * Purpose

For selected files within an application's test suite, determine the points
within a specified range of F<git> commits where the output of a run of each
test materially changes.  Store the test output at those transition points for
human inspection.

=item * Arguments

    $self->multisect_all_targets();

None; all data needed is already present in the object.

=item * Return Value

Returns true value upon success.

=item * Comment

As C<multisect_all_targets()> runs it does two kinds of things:

=over 4

=item *

It stores results data within the object which you can subsequently access through method calls.

=item *

It captures each test output and writes it to a file on disk for later human inspection.

    # The condition for successful multisection of one particular test file
    # target is that the list of md5_hex values for files holding the output of TAP
    # run over the commit range exhibit the following behavior:

    # The list is composed of sub-sequences (a) whose elements are either (i)
    # the md5_hex value for the TAP outputfiles at a given commit or (ii)
    # undefined; (b) if defined, the md5_values are all identical; (c) the
    # first and last elements of the sub-sequence are both defined; and (d)
    # the sub-sequence's unique defined value never reoccurs in any subsequent
    # sub-sequence.

    # For each run of _multisect_one_target() over a given target, it will
    # return a true value (1) if the above condition(s) are met and 0
    # otherwise.  The caller (multisect_all_targets()) will handle that return
    # value appropriately.  The caller will then call _multisect_one_target()
    # on the next target, if any.

    # The objective of multisection is to identify the git commits at which
    # the test output targeted materially changed.  We are using
    # an md5_hex value for that test file as a presumably valid unique
    # identifier for that file's content.  A transition point is a commit at
    # which the output file's md5_hex differs from that of the immediately
    # preceding commit.  So, to identify the first transition point for a
    # given target, we need to locate the commit at which the md5_hex changed
    # from that found in the very first commit in the designated commit range.
    # Once we've identified the first transition point, we'll look for the
    # second transition point, i.e., that where the md5_hex changed from that
    # observed at the first transition point.  We'll continue that process
    # until we get to a transition point where the md5_hex is identical to
    # that of the very last commit in the commit range.

    # This entails checking out the source code at each commit calculated by
    # the bisection algorithm, configuring and building the code, running the
    # test targets at that commit, computing their md5_hex values and storing
    # them in the 'multisected_outputs' structure.  The _prepare_for_multisection()
    # method will pre-populate that structure with md5_hexes for each test
    # file for each of the first and last commits in the commit range.

    # Since the configuration and build at a particular commit may be
    # time-consuming, once we have completed those steps we will run all the
    # test files at once and store their results in 'multisected_outputs'
    # immediately.  We will make our bisection decision based only on analysis
    # of the current target.  But when we come to the second target file we
    # will be able to skip configuration, build and test-running at commits
    # visited during the pass over the first target file.

Get results of C<multisect_all_targets()> (other than test output files
created) reported on a per target/per commit basis.

=item * Arguments

    my $multisected_outputs = $self->get_multisected_outputs();

None; all data needed is already present in the object.

=item * Return Value

Reference to a hash with one element for each targeted test file.

Each element's key is a "stub" version of the target's relative path below the
F<git> checkout directory in which forward slashes and dot characters have
been replaced with underscores.  So,

    t/44_func_hashes_mult_unsorted.t

Each element's value is a reference to an array with one element for each
commit in the commit range.

If a particular commit B<was not visited> in the course of
C<multisect_all_targets()>, then the array element is undefined.  (The point
of multisection, of course, is to B<not> have to visit every commit in the
commit range in order to figure out the commits at which test output changed.)

If a particular commit B<was visited> in the course of
C<multisect_all_targets()>, then the array element is a hash reference whose

=item * Purpose

Get a data structure which reports on the most meaningful results of

transitional commits.

=item * Arguments

    my $transitions = $self->inspect_transitions();

None; all data needed is already present in the object.

Reference to a hash with one element per target.  Each element's key is a
"stub" version of the target's relative path below the F<git> checkout
directory.  (See example in documentation for C<get_multisected_outputs>
above.)

Each element's value is another hash reference.  The elements of that hash
will have the following keys:

=over 4

=item * C<oldest>

Value is reference to hash keyed on C<idx>, C<md5_hex> and C<file>, whose
values are, respectively, the index position of the very first commit in the
commit range, the digest of that commit's test output and the path to the file
holding that output.

=item * C<newest>

Value is reference to hash keyed on C<idx>, C<md5_hex> and C<file>, whose
values are, respectively, the index position of the very last commit in the
commit range, the digest of that commit's test output and the path to the file
holding that output.

=item * C<transitions>

Value is reference to an array with one element for each transitional commit.
Each such element is a reference to a hash with keys C<older> and C<newer>.
In this context C<older> refers to the last commit in a sub-sequence with a
particular digest; C<newer> refers to the next immediate commit which is the
first commit in a new sub-sequence with a new digest.

The values of C<older> and C<newer> are, in turn, references to hashes with
keys C<idx>, C<md5_hex> and C<file>.  Their values are, respectively, the index
position of the particular commit in the commit range, the digest of that
commit's test output and the path to the file holding that output.

The return value of C<inspect_transitions()> should be useful to the developer
trying to determine the various points in a long series of commits where a
target's test output changed in meaningful ways.  Hence, it is really the
whole point of F<Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Transitions>.
