TODO list for Perl module Test::Multisect

2. Create a data structure in the object similar to 'transitions' that
can be accessed to look up results of multisecting.

3. Use 'excluded_targets' to avoid re-running particular test files once we've
completed that target.

4. Decide what to do with 'examine_transitions()', as its behavior depends on
its caller.  Coverage improvement needed for:

    next unless (defined $arr[$i] and defined $arr[$i-1]);

5. Coverage:  need to cover non-verbose runs of prepare_multisect_hash().

6. Coverage:  In run_test_files_on_one_commit(), need to cover a branch in:

    $commit //= $self->{commits}->[0]->{sha};

7. Coverage: Test::Multisect::Auxiliary::validate_list_sequence().

    if (defined $list->[$j]) { $lpd = $list->[$j]; }

8. Documentation: Test::Multisect::Auxiliary::validate_list_sequence() -- DONE.
Several methods in Test::Multisect.

9. Consider renaming prepare_multisect() and prepare_multisect_hash().
They're not, strictly speaking, needed for multisection.

10. Consider placing methods needed for all commits versus bisected commits in
separate packages.
