TODO list for Perl module Test::Multisect

2. Create a data structure in the object similar to 'transitions' that
can be accessed to look up results of multisecting.

3. Use 'excluded_targets' to avoid re-running particular test files once we've
completed that target.

4. Decide what to do with 'examine_transitions()', as its behavior depends on
its caller.  Coverage improvement needed for:

    next unless (defined $arr[$i] and defined $arr[$i-1]);

5. Coverage:  need to cover non-verbose runs of prepare_multisect_hash().

6. Coverage:  In run_test_files_on_one_commit(), need to cover a branch in:

    $commit //= $self->{commits}->[0]->{sha};

7. Coverage: Test::Multisect::Auxiliary::validate_list_sequence().

    if (defined $list->[$j]) { $lpd = $list->[$j]; }

8. Documentation: Test::Multisect::Auxiliary::validate_list_sequence() -- DONE.
Several methods in Test::Muttisect.

9. Better name for identify_transitions() -- DONE.

10. Method comparable to examine_transitions() to extract useful information
transition points from 'bisected_outputs' or 'xall_outputs' once
identify_transitions() has been run.

11. Consider placing methods needed for all commits versus bisected commits in
separate packages -- DONE.

12. Get better package names than Allcommits and Selectedcommits -- DONE.

13. Test on Perl 5 source code.

14. Test CPAN distros that only use Module::Build.

15. Review all source code for locations where verbose output would be
helpful; then implement and test.

16. Assess all comments re request for naming advice on perl.module-authors.

17.  See how much of this .git crap can be removed from MANIFEST.  Example.
