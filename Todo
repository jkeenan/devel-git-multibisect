TODO list for Perl module Test::Multisect

1. Decide whether it will be more fruitful to:
a. Identify all the transition points for the first test target file before
proceeding on to subsequent target file; or
b. Identify the first transition point for the second test target file.

2. Create a data structure in the object similar to 'transitions' that
can be accessed to look up results of multisecting.
