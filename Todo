TODO list for Perl module Devel::Git::MultiBisect

* Functionality

** Use 'excluded_targets' to avoid re-running particular test files once we've
completed that target.

Follow-up (2016-10-30):  This exclusion probably is not relevant under AllCommits, since
our objective there is to be comprehensive rather than selective.  Hence, we
probably don't need to change AllCommits::run_test_files_on_all_commits().
The exclusion would probably be better used in
Transitions::multisect_all_targets().  There, each invocation of 
run_test_files_on_one_commit() needs to be told what targets should now be
excluded.  This would have to be determined within multisect_all_targets().
This feature will be nice to have, but probably can wait until a later
release.

* Testing and Test Coverage

** Need to cover non-verbose runs of prepare_multisect_hash().

** In run_test_files_on_one_commit(), need to cover a branch in:

    $commit //= $self->{commits}->[0]->{sha};

** Devel::Git::MultiBisect::Auxiliary::validate_list_sequence().

    if (defined $list->[$j]) { $lpd = $list->[$j]; }

** Test CPAN distros that only use Module::Build.

* Documentation

* Architecture

** See how much of this .git stuff can be removed from MANIFEST.  Example.

** Created option such that, during configure_command and make_command,
errors will be written to a per-commit error file rather than to STDERR.  For
future release.

** Write scripts multibisect.

19. Considering adding something to Opts to designate the fundamental branch
and then doing a checkout of that branch in preparations for multisecting.
For instance, should new() guarantee that the "fundamental branch" can be
checked out?
REJECTED: wasn't dwimming.

20. Use File::Spec functions to make paths, directory separators safe for
Windows.
DONE

21. Consider adding to verbose output in Transitions info on index within
commit range of commit being tested, etc.
DONE

22. Update README(.md).
