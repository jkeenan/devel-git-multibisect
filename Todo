TODO list for Perl module Test::Multisect

1. Unless /tmp/test_outputs already exists, I can't create it in
Test::Multisect::Opts.  If I can't create it, no CPAN tester would be able to,
either.  Have to figure out workaround.

2. Move two helper subs in Test::Multisect to their own package; test them
individually; comment out most of rest of original package or move to branch
so that I can release a CPAN version and gain access to those helper subs.
