0.08  Sat Jun 15 2002
	- added method get_version()

0.12  Sat Jul 13 2002
	- major expansion
	- capability to accelerate processing of comparisons of 2 lists
	  when only 1 comparison method is expected to be called
	- capability to compare more than 2 lists at a time
	- introduction of methods including:
		get_shared()
		get_nonintersection()
		print_subset_map()
		print_equivalence_map()
	- not released to CPAN due to errors in README and Changes

	- released to CPAN

0.14  Sun Aug 18 2002

	- conformed CPAN addresses of other modules to new structure of search.cpan.org

0.16  Sat Mar 08 2003
	- for each method which returned an array, added an analogous method which
	  returns a reference to that array

0.17  Thu May 22 2003
	- eliminated certain synthetic variables
	- created List::Compare::SeenHash

0.18  Sun Jun 1 2003
	- added methods member_which(), single_member_which()

0.19  Sun Jun 1 2003
	- added methods member_any(), single_member_any()
	- fixed annoying carping messages when running 'make test'

0.20 Fri Jun 6 2003
	- updated documentation discussing changes since v0.17
	- changed names of recently added methods to is_member_which(), is_member_which_ref(),
	  are_members(), is_member_any(), are_members_any()

0.21 Sun Oct 26 2003
	- added functional interface to list comparison functions:  List::Compare::Functional; this required changes in List::Compare::Base::Accelerated and the creation of List::Compare::Base::_Engine

0.22 Sun Nov 23 2003
	- corrected conceptual flaw in List::Compare::SeenHash so as to exclude values in a seen-hash mathematically equal to zero
	- implemented 'unsorted' option for list comparisons

0.23 [Accidentally skipped.]

0.24 Sun Mar 28 2004
	- first implementation of 'multiple accelerated' mode wherein user can request speedier processing of more than two lists when only one comparison among the lists is sought
	- converted test suite to use Test::Simple

0.25 Sun Apr 4 2004
	- continued implementation of 'multiple accelerated' mode; applied to List::Compare::SeenHash and List::Compare::Functional
	- modification of interfaces to methods/functions are_members_which() and are_members_any throughout; items to be tested must be passed (by reference) as an anonymous array rather than as a flat list

0.26  Sun Apr 11 2004
        - List::Compare::SeenHash and associated tests deprecated
        - capacity to pass references to seen-hashes to constructor now
transferred directly into List::Compare
	- corrections to POD

0.27  Sun Apr 18 2004
	- corrections to POD

0.28  Sun Apr 25 2004
	- implementation of is_LdisjointR
	- correction of error in tests of multiple-accelerated mode
	- correction of error in internal subroutine _argument_checker_0
	- further implication of deprecation of List::Compare::SeenHash is that all the code in List::Compare::Base::Regular, L:C:B:Accelerated, L:C:B:Multiple and L:C:B:Multiple::Accelerated is no longer shared between List::Compare and List::Compare::SeenHash and hence can be taken back into List::Compare; thereby eliminating the 'use base' calls from List::Compare.

0.29  Sun May 16 2004
	- implementation of alternative ('Adlerian') interface wherein a single hash reference is passed to constructor or function

0.30  Fri May 21 2004
	- documentation corrections only

0.31  Sun Aug 15 2004
	- added methods get_unique_all() and get_complement_all(); added 3335
tests; repositioned most methods in List::Compare::Base::_Engine to
List::Compare::Accelerated as they were no longer also being used in
List::Compare::Functional; other internal code clean-up

0.32  Sun Sep 18 2005
    - No changes in functionality.  Distribution restructured so that modules
      are now underneath the 'lib/' directory.

0.33  Sun Feb 19 2006
    - Documentation changes only.  Support for List-Compare is now offered via
      dedicated mailing list.

0.34 Mon Nov  5 18:35:15 EST 2007
    - Add require 5.6 to Makefile.PL.

0.35 Sun May 18 19:54:32 EDT 2008
    - Fix bug reported by Charles Bailey.  In object-oriented interface, two
      lists case, get_shared and get_shared_ref should default to
      get_intersection and get_intersection_ref.
    - Complete overhaul of test suite.  Tests are now grouped by interface in
      a more logical order.

0.36 Fri May 23 21:41:55 EDT 2008
    - IO::CaptureOutput was mispositioned:  should have been directly under t/
      rather than under t/Test/.

0.37 Sat Jun  7 19:46:52 EDT 2008
    - Tests refined and code refactored so as to achieve 100% subroutine,
      statement, branch and condition coverage by test suite as measured by
      Devel::Cover.  Some cleanup of POD.

0.38 Thu Sep  5 21:09:10 EDT 2013
    - Update support information; no longer using dedicated mailing list.

0.39 Fri Jul  4 15:38:24 EDT 2014
    - Repository migrated from Subversion to git.  Development repository
      initiated at https://github.com/jkeenan/list-compare.

0.40 Sat Feb  7 08:39:06 EST 2015
    - Eliminated three unnecessary hash assignments.

0.41 Sun Feb  8 20:38:46 EST 2015
    - Revised List::Compare::Functional::_intersection_engine() to eliminate
      need to call _calculate_xintersection_only() and
      _calculate_hash_intersection();

    - Improve performance of four List::Compare::Functional functions.

0.43 Thu Feb 12 19:14:35 EST 2015
    - Improve performance of two List::Compare::Functional functions.

      get_shared
      get_shared_ref

0.44 Sun Feb 15 14:40:06 EST 2015
    - Improve performance of complement-related functions in both functional
      and object-oriented interfaces:

      get_complement
      get_complement_ref
      get_complement_all

0.45 Mon Feb 16 16:59:03 EST 2015
    - Improve performance of unique-related functions in both functional and
      object-oriented interfaces:

      get_unique
      get_unique_ref
      get_unique_all

0.46 Wed Feb 18 19:30:30 EST 2015
    - Improve performance of List::Compare::Multiple::Accelerated methods:

      get_intersection
      get_intersection_ref
      get_shared
      get_shared_ref

0.47 Sun Feb 22 08:17:54 EST 2015
    - Improve performance of List::Compare::Multiple::Accelerated methods:

      get_nonintersection
      get_nonintersection_ref
      get_symmetric_difference
      get_symmetric_difference_ref

0.48 Wed Feb 25 17:59:30 EST 2015
    - Improve performance of is_LdisjointR in List::Compare::Functional and in
      multiple accelerated mode of List::Compare.

0.49 Sun Mar  8 20:06:20 EDT 2015

0.50 Sat May  9 09:06:41 EDT 2015
    - Improve performance of is_LsubsetR via patches submitted by Mich Rawson
      at New York Perl Hackathon (May 2 2015).

0.51 Thu May 14 21:49:00 EDT 2015
    - Changes to List::Compare::Functional::is_LsubsetR introduced in v0.50
      found to be buggy.  See: https://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=104452.
      Pending further investigation, reverted to v0.49 of
      List::Compare::Base::_Auxiliary; added two test files.

0.52 Thu May 21 21:57:18 EDT 2015
    - v0.51 changes were not applied to master branch; apply them.
      Remove two hash-to-hash assignments in List::Compare::Base::_Auxiliary::_subset_subengine.

0.53 Sun Jun  7 10:49:24 MDT 2015
    - Accept patch submitted by Paulo Custodio reworking, and correcting,
      changes originally published in 0.50.
